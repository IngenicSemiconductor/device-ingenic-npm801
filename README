                                        Android-4.3 Release Note
                                        ------------------------

Put all files here into $ANDROID_ROOT/device/ingenic/npm801/
Copy 0001-Adding-configuration-files-for-bluetooth-npm801.patch to device/commont/libbt and apply for BT@npm801.

****PART ONE: Building the System****
1. Initialize the environment with the envsetup.sh script.
    $ source build/envsetup.sh
or
    $ . build/envsetup.sh

2. Choose target.
    $ lunch full_npm801-userdebug

3. Build everything.
    $ make -j24

**** PART TWO: Flashing the device ****
Because fastboot is related to bootloader, the x-boot-nand.bin must be updated.
This only needs to be done once per tablet.
---- updating x-boot ----
1. Connect the device to PC by USB cable and plug charger into the device.

2. Put device into USB-BOOT mode by pressing both Vol+ and reset at the same time
   and keeping Vol+ pressed for at least 2 seconds after reset is released.

3. Note that the screen is blank in this mode.

4. Check if the device entered USB boot mode correctly using 'lsusb'.
   'xxxx:4780' is the target.

5. $ cd ingenic-xboot-updater

6. $ sudo ./ingenic-xboot-updater --boot=x-boot-nand.bin


---- Flashing with FASTBOOT ----
1. Press 'return' and do a reset, keep 'return' key pressed until fastboot screen appears.

2. The USB icon in the center of screen will show if you have a proper USB connection.

3. Run fastboot on host. You can run fastboot as a normal user if your udev rules
   include the tablet device ID. Otherwise, you need to run fastboot as root::
   $ sudo -s
   # cd 'Android-root'
   # . build/envsetup.sh
   # lunch full_npm801-userdebug
   # fastboot flashall

NOTE: Because the system is 640MB, flashall will take about 10 Minutes.
      There is a progress indicator onscreen.
